There were several problems in the design of the ADEC software that were made apparent as the software entered field quality testing and user test. The program managers chose me to lead a small 3 month effort to demonstrate implementing better software design for the system. The refactor demonstrated how concepts like dependency injection could lead to improved software through decoupling and easier testing. It also demonstrated how implementing patterns such as repository patterns between services and the database as well as model view view model on the client could lead to more maintainable software. It also demonstrated using REST services versus WCF soap services. This prototype also showed improved database interaction through the use of ORM tools like entity framework. The prototype was a success in that most patterns and tools demonstrated were integrated as permitted into the ADEC baseline.",
